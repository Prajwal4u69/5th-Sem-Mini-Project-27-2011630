This project is based upon stock market analysis
In this I have also added bid price too..
here the pricess get updated dynamically


1:I am using here Google Finance API to update the chart.
2:Data dynamically provides bid  , bid size,ask ,ask size and stock at that price available

Advantages:
1:If i close my localhost then , my app still trying to connect.
2:If i zoom in or zoom the web browser then chart automatically resize it self.
3:Here i have mentioned checkbox , that select and not select different companies and on the basis of that chart is selected tand sde selected


here you can run command by
npm install
webpack --watch  to transpile React/ES6 JavaScript to bundle.js
